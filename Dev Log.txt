Done:
* defined newSwap function (line 238, main.py) to make create swaps easier when backtesting
* designed a function to print all cashflows of a given swap (peak ctrl+shift+7)
* changed the calendar to China.IB and updated corresponding fr007 & s3m closings

To do:
* Re-assign a swap engine to an existing swap, swap valuation functions (npv, bps, printcashflow) should be ready
* comment out % in main.py
* Remove the dependency on curve engine when building swaps
