Done:
* defined newSwap function (line 238, main.py) to make create swaps easier when backtesting
* designed a function to print all cashflows of a given swap (peak ctrl+shift+7)
* changed the calendar to China.IB and updated corresponding fr007 & s3m closings
* Comment out "%" in main.py (Commented out wind python package as well)
* Re-assign a swap engine to an existing swap, swap valuation functions (npv, bps, printcashflow) should be ready (Solved. It's because of not setting evaluationDate in printCashflow() )
* Remove the dependency on curve engine when building swaps (Actually QuantLib requires to add the index when building the swap, and the index is in curve object, so I have to use the curve object when building swaps.)
